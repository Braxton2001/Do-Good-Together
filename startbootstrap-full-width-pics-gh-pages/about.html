My purpose is to cultivate growth—in myself and others—by fostering meaningful connections, embracing creativity, and living in alignment with my values. Through my career in Human Resources, I aim to create environments where people feel empowered, supported, and inspired to grow. I strive to approach life with a sense of wonder, appreciating the beauty in nature and the world around me. Grounded in my faith I seek to live with kindness, wisdom, power and to do good, together. I am always excited to meet new people! Connect with me!</p>

                        <p class="lead">Where I see myself in 5-10 years</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">My expected graduation date from Brigham Young University is April 2026. I plan on getting SHRM certified in my last year of university, helping me in my career as a HR professional. After graduating I am considering an International MBA in Barcelona, Spain. I have always loved different cultures and languages and the social blend of our collective humanity. I speak Spanish and I interned in Spain in Valencia in 2024, and I loved it. Throughout all generations, nations, and languages, we are all human, and I believe humans are inherently good. We are one body, one voice, and one people, and there is power in that understanding. I want to utilize that power to make the world a better and more connected place.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">After obtaining an International MBA, I plan to either work in the US or in Europe. I want to work for creative companies. Life is fun and full of unknown territory, and untold stories. I want to help employees tell these stories and help them create content that brings imagination to life and make dreams a reality.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">My ultimate goal is to eventually become a CHRO of a company. I am passionate about HR and its impact on a company and the good HR brings to the table. Organizations are better places to work and make a larger impact on the world when HR departments are empowered to implement strategic practices. We are the guardians of organizations and society is comprised of systems and organizations; we have a sacred duty to influence organizations and therefore society for good.</p>
